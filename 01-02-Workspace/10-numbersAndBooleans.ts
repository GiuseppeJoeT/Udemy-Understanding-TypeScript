// Number type
let integer = 32;
let floatingPoint = 32.1;

// If it is an integer or a float that is both type a NUMBER, there is no differentiation between that in TypeScript.

// Boolean
let hasHobbies = true;
hasHobbies = 0;

// It still gives me an error because one is a number and hasHobbies is a boolean and or it likes to have booleans and not numbers.
