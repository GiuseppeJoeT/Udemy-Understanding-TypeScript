// Number type
var integer = 32;
var floatingPoint = 32.1;
// If it is an integer or a float that is both type a NUMBER, there is no differentiation between that in TypeScript.
// Boolean
var hasHobbies = true;
hasHobbies = 0;
// It still gives me an error because one is a number and hasHobbies is a boolean and or it likes to have booleans and not numbers.
